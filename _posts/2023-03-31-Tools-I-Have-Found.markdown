## These are some of my favourite tools I have found so far:

#### Dissassembly:
- Cutter - https://cutter.re/  

This is still very new, however it is extremely visually appealing which I find stimulates me to use this software to learn more often. Cutter does use the ghidra decompiler, however I moreso see this as a replacement for IDA.


- IDA Free - https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/  

IDA Free is a great piece of software that is the industry standard from my understanding. Quite hard to beat.

#### Decompilation:
- Ghidra - https://ghidra-sre.org/  

I mean, what else would you be using here? It is state of the art! 

#### Debuggers:
- GDB/GEF - https://github.com/hugsy/gef 

This is an obvious choice, however by itself I find it to be quite clunky, luckily `gef` came to the rescue and provided me with an output that is inifinitely more readable and usable.

#### Hex Editor:
I tried many different Hex Editors however I found many of them to be clunky, out-of-date, featureless, visually unappealing, or barely worked to do the tasks that I required it to.

##### Editors I tried:
- HxD editor
- Hex Editor Neo
- wxHexEditor

I would have liked to use `010 Hex Editor` as it seems to be the leading fully featured hex editor on the market, however I could not currently justify the cost.

I was stumped, nothing fit my needs and I found myself having to compromise to use one of these editors, until I stumbled upon a beatiful piece of software..... 

- ImHex - https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex  

ImHex looks great (in my opinion), and has the following features; Pattern Matching, Regex and String searching, Data Inspectors, Bookmarks, Data Analyzers, Yara Rules, Rudimentary disassembler, File Hashing, Great Hex Viewer, and best of all, I toggle all these features to be displayed or not, move them to my desired location with tabs!

#### Compilers:
- FASM - https://flatassembler.net/  
- SASM - https://dman95.github.io/SASM/english.html  

Both of these are invaluable for writing my own assembly to test, learn and develop my skills.
