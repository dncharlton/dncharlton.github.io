## The plan for my journey
This is the plan I have in place for studying for Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation.

I am enamoured by the site [pwnable.kr](pwnable.kr/) however with my limited knowledge I foundd these challenges to more challenging then they initially appeared, the first challenge `fd` was simple enough as a simple stdin exploit. However I soon found myself at the second challenge, `collision`. 

This is when I know that I needed to expand my knowledge of x86 Assembly and Debugging, Decompilation and Reverse Engineering further.

It was at this time I found the following resources:
- [Nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/)
- [xorpd - Assembly Language Adventures](https://www.xorpd.net/pages/x86_adventures.html) / [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/x86-asm-foundations/)

I am working my way through Nightmare and xorpd's Udemy course whilst working on older Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering Challenges I am finding online e.g. picoCTF and will be building my skills from here!
